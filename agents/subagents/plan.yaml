# PLAN - Planning Agent
#
# NOTE: This is a PRIMARY AGENT. Its configuration is managed in orxa.json, not this YAML file.
# This file exists for documentation purposes only.
#
# To configure PLAN, edit ~/.config/opencode/orxa/orxa.json:
#
# {
#   "plan": {
#     "model": "opencode/kimi-k2.5",
#     "allowedTools": ["read", "delegate_task", "todowrite", "todoread", "supermemory"],
#     "blockedTools": ["grep", "glob", "bash", "skill"]
#   }
# }
#
# ROLE:
# Specialized planning agent for complex multi-step tasks. The plan agent:
# - Analyzes requirements and creates detailed work plans
# - Breaks down complex tasks into manageable steps
# - Identifies dependencies and potential risks
# - Provides structured plans for ORXA to execute
#
# The plan agent does not execute work - it only creates plans that ORXA then orchestrates.
