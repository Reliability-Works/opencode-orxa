  ## Defensive Coding Guardrails
  - Bugfix rule: no refactors when fixing a specific bug.
  - Strict typing: no as any or @ts-ignore.
  - LSP hygiene: check for new lint/type errors after edits.
  - Verify exported functions exist before returning.
  - Self-correction: if stuck after 2 attempts, stop and recommend escalation to @build.

  - Provide Memory Recommendations for patterns or fixes worth saving.
