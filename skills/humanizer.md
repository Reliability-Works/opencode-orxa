# Humanizer - Remove AI Writing Patterns

## Overview

When editing or reviewing text, remove signs of AI-generated writing to make content sound more natural and human-written.

## Common AI Writing Patterns to Fix

### 1. Inflated Symbolism
**AI Pattern:** Using grand metaphors and flowery language
**Fix:** Use concrete, specific language

**Before:** "In the ever-evolving landscape of digital innovation..."
**After:** "As technology changes..."

### 2. Promotional Language
**AI Pattern:** Hype-heavy marketing speak
**Fix:** Be factual and specific

**Before:** "Revolutionary game-changing solution that transforms your workflow"
**After:** "Tool that automates email sorting and saves 2 hours per week"

### 3. Superficial -ing Analyses
**AI Pattern:** "This is interesting/fascinating/compelling because..."
**Fix:** Explain the actual significance

**Before:** "This is a fascinating development in the field..."
**After:** "This matters because it reduces processing time by 40%..."

### 4. Vague Attributions
**AI Pattern:** "Many people say..." "Experts believe..."
**Fix:** Be specific or remove

**Before:** "Many experts agree that this approach works"
**After:** "In a 2023 study of 500 developers, 78% reported..."

### 5. Excessive Em Dashes
**AI Pattern:** Overusing em dashes for emphasis
**Fix:** Use commas, parentheses, or separate sentences

**Before:** "The solution—while effective—requires careful implementation"
**After:** "The solution is effective, but requires careful implementation"

### 6. Rule of Three
**AI Pattern:** Always listing three items
**Fix:** Use the number that makes sense

**Before:** "We need to focus on speed, quality, and reliability"
**After:** "We need to focus on speed and reliability" (if that's all that matters)

### 7. AI Vocabulary Words
**AI Pattern:** Overusing certain words
**Fix:** Use simpler alternatives

**Replace:**
- "Leverage" → "use"
- "Delve" → "explore" or "look at"
- "Realm" → "area" or "field"
- "Tapestry" → "mix" or "combination"
- "Landscape" → "situation" or "market"
- "Bustling" → "busy"
- "Vibrant" → "active" or "colorful"
- "Resonate" → "connect" or "appeal"
- "Embark" → "start"
- "Journey" → "process" or "project"

### 8. Negative Parallelisms
**AI Pattern:** "Not X, but Y" structures
**Fix:** State positively what it is

**Before:** "This is not just a tool, but a paradigm shift"
**After:** "This tool changes how teams work"

### 9. Excessive Conjunctive Phrases
**AI Pattern:** "Moreover, furthermore, consequently, therefore..."
**Fix:** Use simpler transitions or remove

**Before:** "Furthermore, this approach enables better results"
**After:** "This approach also enables better results"

### 10. Generic Openings
**AI Pattern:** "In today's world..." "In the modern era..."
**Fix:** Start with the point

**Before:** "In today's rapidly changing business environment..."
**After:** "Companies now face..."

## Sentence Structure Fixes

### Vary Sentence Length
**AI Pattern:** All sentences similar length
**Fix:** Mix short and long sentences

**Before:** "The system processes data efficiently. It uses advanced algorithms. These algorithms optimize performance."
**After:** "The system processes data fast. It uses advanced algorithms that optimize performance by analyzing patterns in real-time."

### Remove Filler Phrases
**Cut these:**
- "It's important to note that..."
- "It's worth mentioning that..."
- "As a matter of fact..."
- "In order to..." → "To..."
- "Due to the fact that..." → "Because..."
- "At this point in time..." → "Now..."

### Active Voice
**AI Pattern:** Passive constructions
**Fix:** Use active voice

**Before:** "The report was written by the team"
**After:** "The team wrote the report"

## Tone Adjustments

### Be Direct
**AI Pattern:** Hedging and qualification
**Fix:** State clearly

**Before:** "It seems that this might possibly be the best approach"
**After:** "This is the best approach"

### Show Don't Tell
**AI Pattern:** Telling the reader what to think
**Fix:** Present evidence

**Before:** "This is a significant improvement"
**After:** "This reduces load time from 5 seconds to 200ms"

### Use Contractions
**AI Pattern:** "do not, cannot, will not"
**Fix:** "don't, can't, won't" (in casual/formal contexts)

## Context-Specific Fixes

### Technical Writing
- Remove: "In the world of..."
- Use: Specific technical terms
- Be precise with numbers and metrics

### Business Writing
- Remove: "Synergy, holistic, paradigm"
- Use: Concrete business outcomes
- Include specific ROI or metrics

### Creative Writing
- Remove: Cliché metaphors
- Use: Original, specific imagery
- Show emotion through action

### Academic Writing
- Remove: "Very, really, quite, rather"
- Use: Precise qualifiers
- Cite specific sources
